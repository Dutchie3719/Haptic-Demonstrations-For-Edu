# 3D Printed Haptic Illusions and Demonstrations 
<img align="left" width="400" src="image/haptistrap_main.JPG">

Appreciating a sensory illusion often requires you to experience it with your own senses. While this is generally trivial for visual and auditory illusions that can be rendered using commonly available hardware, haptic illusions often require complex mechanical systems.
Vincent Hayward’s, “A brief taxonomy of tactile illusions and demonstrations that can be done in a hardware store” introduced simple and affordable DIY assemblies to make haptic illusions more accessible.
However, we argue that the skills and materials required to fabricate the illusions he describes are often non-trivial, thereby depriving the paper’s intended audience from experiencing and learning about these haptic illusions.
As a novel, more accessible alternative, we propose a series of haptic illusions and demonstrations that can be fabricated using any FDM 3D printer.
Once printed, they can be fully assembled by hand.

In this repository you will find all necessary 3D model files (.stl) and printing guidelines to fabricate your own set of 3D printed illusions and demonstrations.

# 3D printing guidelines

The table below specifics the files necessary to fabricate each illusion, provides a few guidelines on how to print each activity and shows an example of model layout on the 3D printer's print surface.

This work is heavily inspired by "A brief taxonomy of tactile illusions and demonstrations that can be done in a hardware store" by Vincent Hayward. We believe that our efforts are aligned with Hayward's original intent, which was to make tactile illusions and demonstrations more accessible to the general public.
